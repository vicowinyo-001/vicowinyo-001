# 👋 Hi, I'm Victor Owinyo

## 👋 About Me

I'm Victor Owinyo, a curious and creative software engineering enthusiast currently exploring automation workflows, AI-powered education, and chemistry learning tools.  
I thrive at the intersection of code, pedagogy, and storytelling—building projects that make learning more engaging and accessible.  

Currently part of the **PLP Academy Software Engineering Essentials** program, I'm sharpening my skills in Git, Python (among other programing languages), and project management while contributing to open-source and hackathon-ready ideas.  

Let’s connect and build something meaningful together. 🚀
